# Deconstructing Masculinity — Process

## Intent

This series was created through a deliberate unlearning. The process involved identifying inherited behaviors, expectations, and internalized scripts around masculinity, then breaking them apart visually to examine what remains when those structures collapse.

The goal was not to destroy masculinity itself, but to question the narrow archetype society enforces—and to create space for more expansive, human definitions of what it means to be male.

## Method

**Medium:** Portrait Photography
**Approach:** Collaborative portraiture with subjects of varying gender expressions and perspectives

- Casting subjects who challenge traditional masculine archetypes through their existence, presentation, or philosophy
- Creating safe, vulnerable space during portrait sessions to allow authentic expression
- Using minimal styling and natural light to emphasize humanity over performance
- Employing stark contrast and direct gaze to confront the viewer
- Editing with restraint—allowing subjects to speak for themselves without heavy manipulation

## Technical Process

- Shot on digital format for clarity and detail
- Natural and studio lighting to create intimacy
- Black and white processing to remove distraction and emphasize form, expression, and emotion
- High-resolution prints to honor each subject's presence

## Reflection

This process was less about destruction and more about excavation—making room for versions of masculinity not defined by rigidity, dominance, or emotional suppression. Each portrait became a quiet refusal of the script we've all been handed.

The collaborative nature of the work was essential. These aren't just my interpretations—they're co-created moments where subjects brought their own truths about gender, identity, and what it means to exist outside prescribed boundaries.
