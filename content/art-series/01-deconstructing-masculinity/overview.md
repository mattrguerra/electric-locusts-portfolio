# Deconstructing Masculinity

*Portrait Series challenging societal expectations of manhood*

---

## Overview

The archetypal man in our society operates within impossibly narrow boundaries.

To be considered valid, he must be cisgender and heterosexual. He must be stoic—never showing vulnerability. Emotionally unavailable. Aggressive when necessary. Dominant in all spaces. Any deviation from this script invites questioning, ridicule, or exclusion.

These expectations damage everyone.

They create a culture where femininity is demonized and men are forbidden from accessing their full emotional range. They prevent men from seeking help for mental health struggles—contributing directly to crisis-level rates of suicide, addiction, and isolation. They harm women and non-binary people who bear the consequences of this enforced emotional suppression.

*Deconstructing Masculinity* confronts these limitations directly.

This portrait series presents men of varying races, gender expressions, and perspectives on what it means to identify as male. Each subject challenges the narrow archetype in their own way—through vulnerability, through softness, through simply existing outside the prescribed boundaries.

The work asks viewers to examine their own assumptions: What do we expect men to be? Who benefits from those expectations? What becomes possible when we expand our definitions?

Masculinity doesn't have to mean emotional absence. Strength doesn't require suppression. This series imagines what manhood could look like if we allowed it to include the full spectrum of human experience.
