# What We Were Left With — Process

## Intent

This series was created to document and process the aftermath of trauma and addiction. The intent was to revisit my personal archive—photographs taken during years of active substance abuse—and transform them into something that could hold both the pain of that period and the evidence of survival.

The work serves multiple purposes: validation of lived experience, illumination of the connection between trauma and mental health, and an offering of hope.

## Method

**Medium:** Documentary / Archival Photography  
**Approach:** Curation and recontextualization of personal archive

- Revisiting photographs taken during active addiction and trauma
- Selecting images that document the reality of substance abuse and its consequences
- Curating the archive into a coherent visual narrative
- Recontextualizing personal documentation as public art
- Allowing the rawness of the original images to remain intact
- Creating distance through time—looking back at what was survived

## Technical Process

- Working with existing photographs from personal archive (various formats and qualities)
- Minimal editing to preserve authenticity and documentary nature
- Sequencing images to create narrative arc from crisis to aftermath
- Printing at various scales depending on emotional weight of each image
- Archival presentation to honor the significance of survival
- Treating the archive as evidence—proof that the experience was real

## Reflection

The process of revisiting these images was both painful and necessary. Trauma can make you question your memories, minimize your suffering, or convince you that what happened wasn't real. Seeing the evidence—having it exist outside my own mind—confirms that I went through something significant and survived it.

Curating this work required me to look directly at the darkest chapter of my life without flinching. There were images I couldn't include because they were too raw, too private, or too triggering. The selection process itself became an act of boundary-setting and self-care.

What emerged is a visual diary of aftermath—the fragments, echoes, and emotional residue that remain long after the acute crisis has passed. This is what we were left with: the scars, the memories, the changed landscape of a life that survived something it wasn't sure it would.

The fact that I can look back at these images—that I'm still here to curate them, to speak about them, to transform them into art—is evidence that recovery is possible. The human spirit can survive devastating circumstances. There is always potential for healing and growth, even from the darkest places.

This work illuminates the connection between trauma and mental health. Addiction doesn't happen in isolation—it's often a response to pain that feels otherwise unmanageable. By showing both the behavior and its roots, I hope to build understanding for those still struggling.

Finally, this series is an offering of hope. If you're in the middle of your own dark chapter, please know: you can survive this. And on the other side, you'll be able to look back and see how far you've come.
