# Exposure — Process

## Intent

This series was created to visualize the experience of depression—specifically the feeling of being emotionally exposed, stripped bare, and left vulnerable without protective layers. The intent was to make the invisible visible: to externalize what depression feels like from the inside for those who have never experienced it, and to create recognition for those who have.

Depression thrives in isolation and silence. This work attempts to break both.

## Method

**Medium:** Photography
**Approach:** Self-portraiture and environmental documentation

- Using the camera as a tool for self-examination during depressive episodes
- Capturing moments of raw vulnerability without performance or artifice
- Employing metaphor and symbolism to represent emotional states (weight, darkness, exposure, fragmentation)
- Working slowly—matching the pace of depression itself
- Creating during periods when making anything felt nearly impossible
- Allowing the difficulty of the process to become part of the work's meaning

## Technical Process

- Shot on digital and medium format film
- Natural light to emphasize rawness and authenticity
- Minimal post-processing—honoring the unvarnished reality of the experience
- Black and white and muted color palettes to reflect emotional flatness
- Intentional use of negative space to convey emptiness and isolation
- Long exposure times mirroring the slow, heavy passage of time during depression

## Reflection

The process of creating *Exposure* was itself an act of exposure—forcing myself to look directly at what I was experiencing and give it form. There were days when lifting the camera felt impossible. Those days became part of the work.

Depression is insidious in its approach. It arrives slowly, dismantling you piece by piece until you're standing naked in your own fragility. This series documents that unraveling—not to glorify suffering, but to validate it, to say: this is real, this is heavy, and if you're carrying it, you're not alone.

My hope is that viewers who have experienced depression will feel seen, and those who haven't might develop new understanding. Art can be a bridge across that gap.
