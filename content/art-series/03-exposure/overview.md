# Exposure

*Photography Series on depression and vulnerability*

---

## Overview

Depression arrives slowly.

The things you once enjoyed become objects of apathy. Getting out of bed feels like dragging weights that leave trails in the ground behind you. Work becomes impossible. Joy becomes a memory you're not sure was ever real.

But what depression does most profoundly is leave you feeling *exposed*.

Naked and raw in your emotions, you begin to unravel—bit by bit, piece by piece—until there's nothing left to hide behind. The protective layers you've built over a lifetime dissolve, and you're left standing in full view of your own fragility.

Depression is insidious in its approach. Its silent predation creeps so gradually that you don't recognize what's happening until you're already deep inside it. By the time you understand, the weight has become part of you.

I created *Exposure* because I needed people to understand this experience.

I've fought depression for years, often feeling like no one around me could comprehend the magnitude of what I was carrying. This series attempts to visualize that weight—to make the invisible visible, to externalize what depression feels like from the inside.

My hope is that viewers who have experienced this will feel seen, and those who haven't might develop new understanding. Depression thrives in isolation and silence. Art can be a way to break both.
