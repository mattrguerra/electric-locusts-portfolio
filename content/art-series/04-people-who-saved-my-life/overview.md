# People Who Saved My Life

*Cyanotype Portrait Series honoring connection and gratitude*

---

## Overview

Creating work about mental health means constantly confronting darkness.

The subject matter of most of my practice carries an unavoidable weight—themes of depression, addiction, and identity crisis that can feel overwhelming to live inside. Recently, I recognized that this constant engagement with negativity was affecting my own wellbeing. I was addressing the same pain repeatedly without making space for what had also been true: I survived because of other people.

This series is a deliberate shift toward gratitude.

*People Who Saved My Life* presents five portraits printed as cyanotypes—the ethereal blue tones creating an almost sacred quality around each subject. These are the people whose presence kept me alive. Their support, patience, and love formed the foundation that allowed me to keep going when I couldn't see a reason to.

On the reverse of each cyanotype is a handwritten letter to that person, thanking them for what they've meant to my survival. The work exists as both public tribute and private correspondence.

Without these five people, I truly don't believe I would have made it.

This series is a testament to the vital importance of support networks. It's evidence that connection can be the difference between life and death—and a reminder that acknowledging the people who save us is itself an act of healing.
