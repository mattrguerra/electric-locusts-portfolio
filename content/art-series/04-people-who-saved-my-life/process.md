# People Who Saved My Life — Process

## Intent

This series was created as a deliberate shift from documenting darkness to honoring light. After years of making work about mental health struggles, I recognized that constant engagement with negativity was affecting my wellbeing. This project became a way to acknowledge what had also been true: I survived because of other people.

The intent was to create both public tribute and private correspondence—to thank the five people whose presence kept me alive.

## Method

**Medium:** Cyanotype prints on watercolor paper with handwritten letters  
**Approach:** Collaborative portraiture with alternative process printing

- Selecting five individuals whose support, patience, and love formed the foundation of my survival
- Creating intimate portrait sessions that honored each person's significance
- Printing portraits as cyanotypes—the ethereal blue tones creating an almost sacred quality
- Writing personal letters of gratitude on the reverse of each print
- Combining public art with private communication—the work exists in both realms simultaneously

## Technical Process

- Portrait photography shot on digital format
- Conversion to high-contrast negatives for cyanotype printing
- Hand-coating watercolor paper with cyanotype chemistry
- Contact printing under UV light (sunlight or UV exposure unit)
- Washing and fixing prints to archival standards
- Handwriting letters on the reverse—making each piece unique and unrepeatable
- Mounting and framing to preserve both image and text

## Reflection

The process of creating this series was profoundly emotional. Each portrait session required vulnerability—not just from me, but from the subjects who had to sit with the weight of knowing they'd saved someone's life.

Writing the letters was equally difficult. How do you adequately thank someone for your survival? How do you put that magnitude into words? The letters are imperfect, but they're honest.

This work represents a turning point in my practice: acknowledging that while darkness is real, so is the light that gets us through it. Support networks are not abstract concepts—they are specific people who show up, who stay, who hold space when you can't hold yourself together.

Without these five people, I truly don't believe I would have made it. This series is evidence that connection can be the difference between life and death—and a reminder that acknowledging the people who save us is itself an act of healing.
