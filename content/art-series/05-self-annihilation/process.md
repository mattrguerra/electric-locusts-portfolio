# Self-Annihilation — Process

## Intent

This series was created to excavate and externalize the darkest corners of my experience with identity crisis, mental illness, and addiction. The intent was to give visual form to the feeling of losing yourself—of being so disconnected from your own identity that you become a hollow shell.

The work required me to confront what I'd survived without protection or distance. It was the most difficult series I've ever created.

## Method

**Mediums:** Medium format film photography, scratched/burned negatives, archival prints, artist book, video
**Approach:** Physical destruction as metaphor for psychological destruction

- Beginning with self-portraits shot on medium format film
- Physically scratching and burning my own image from the negatives—removing myself from the frame
- Using destruction as a visual language for self-annihilation
- Expanding into multiple mediums: prints, an artist book functioning as a public diary, and video work
- Documenting the cycle of mental illness and substance abuse in unflinching detail
- Creating without self-protection—allowing the work to be as raw as the experience

## Technical Process

**Photography:**
- Shot on medium format film (120mm) for detail and texture
- Developing negatives in traditional darkroom process
- Physically altering negatives with sharp tools (scratching) and fire (burning)
- Printing damaged negatives to archival paper—preserving the destruction
- Each print becomes unique due to the physical manipulation

**Artist Book:**
- Compiling images, text, and documentation into a bound diary format
- Sequencing to create narrative arc through the experience
- Allowing others to "read" the most private moments of crisis
- Using the book format to create intimacy and vulnerability

**Video:**
- Creating moving image work that hints at the devastating effects of addiction
- Using fragmentation, repetition, and visual distortion
- Sound design to amplify psychological states

## Reflection

The process of creating *Self-Annihilation* was an act of survival in itself. By externalizing the experience—by making it visible outside my own mind—I could begin to process what had happened and confirm that it was real.

Trauma can make you question your memories, minimize your suffering, or convince you that what happened wasn't significant. Seeing the evidence, having it exist as physical objects in the world, validates the experience.

Scratching and burning my own image felt violent, but it was honest. That's what addiction and mental illness do—they erase you piece by piece until you don't recognize yourself anymore.

If viewing this work inspires even one person to advocate for mental health care—or makes someone battling similar demons feel less alone—then every painful moment of its creation was worth it. The human spirit can survive devastating circumstances. There is always potential for healing and growth, even from the darkest places.
