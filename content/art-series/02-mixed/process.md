# Mixed — Process

## Intent

The series emerged from the lived experience of bipolar mixed episodes—psychological states where depression and mania occur simultaneously. The intent was not to explain this condition intellectually, but to create visual equivalents of the internal chaos, contradiction, and impossible coexistence of opposing energies.

This work was made during crisis, functioning as both documentation and survival mechanism.

## Method

**Medium:** Mixed media / Visual art
**Approach:** Intuitive, crisis-driven creation

- Working during active mixed episodes to capture authentic psychological states
- Combining disparate visual styles and techniques to mirror internal fragmentation
- Layering contradictory elements: chaos and structure, movement and stillness, color and void
- Allowing intuitive choices to guide composition without forcing coherence
- Embracing visual contradictions (soft vs. sharp, bright vs. muted, calm vs. violent)
- Creating without the expectation of resolution—honoring states that refuse simplification

## Technical Process

- Mixed media: digital manipulation, collage, photography, drawing, painting
- No single consistent technique—the medium shifts with the emotional state
- Rapid creation during manic phases; slow, heavy editing during depressive phases
- Intentional visual dissonance to externalize internal experience
- Archival of raw emotional output without excessive refinement

## Reflection

The process honored states of being that resist language and refuse clean categorization. Mixed episodes are not "sad" or "energized"—they are both, neither, and something else entirely. The work attempts to hold that impossibility.

Creating during crisis became a way to externalize what I couldn't contain alone. The act of making gave form to formlessness, and in doing so, made survival slightly more possible.

This series is for anyone who has felt that particular kind of alone—the isolation of experiencing something you can't adequately describe. You are not broken. You are not imagining it. And you are not the only one.
