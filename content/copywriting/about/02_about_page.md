**Title:** About the Artist

**Subtitle:** Transforming lived experience into visual advocacy for mental health awareness

## Introduction

I'm Matt Guerra—a visual artist working at the intersection of photography, mixed media, and personal narrative.

My work is an ongoing examination of identity, vulnerability, and the complexities of mental health. Through medium format film, alternative processes like cyanotype printing, video art, and mixed media installations, I transform my experiences with addiction, depression, and bipolar disorder into visual stories that I hope resonate beyond my own life.

Art has become my primary tool for processing trauma and advocating for change. Every piece I create is both a personal excavation and an invitation—asking viewers to sit with difficult emotions and recognize pieces of their own experience in the work.

## Artist Statement

> Identity has always been something I've struggled to define. The search for where I fit in the world has shaped both my life and my art practice in profound ways. Living with mental illness and navigating addiction has left me feeling broken, confused, and uncertain—but it has also given me something urgent to say.
>
> My work began with self-portraits on medium format film, physically scratching and burning my own image from the negatives. What started as destruction became transformation—a way to visualize the hollow feeling of being lost within yourself. From there, my practice expanded into artist books, video installations, and portrait series that explore gratitude, masculinity, and the weight of depression.
>
> I create art because I believe in its power to connect us. If even one person views my work and decides to fight for mental health advocacy—or simply feels a little less alone—then every difficult moment spent making it will have been worth it.

## Creative Philosophy

**Authenticity Over Aesthetics**
My work prioritizes emotional truth over technical perfection. The rawness is intentional—it reflects the reality of living with mental illness.

**Art as Advocacy**
Every series I create carries a message about mental health awareness. Art can change perspectives, reduce stigma, and save lives.

**Connection Through Vulnerability**
By sharing my darkest moments publicly, I create space for others to acknowledge their own struggles. Vulnerability is not weakness—it's the foundation of genuine human connection.
