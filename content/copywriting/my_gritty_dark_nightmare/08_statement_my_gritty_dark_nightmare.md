# Artist Statement: My Gritty, Dark Nightmare

*Documentary Photography Series on addiction and trauma*

---

## Statement

My art practice has become a tool for processing what I've survived.

This series draws from my personal archive—photographs taken during years of active addiction and the aftermath of trauma. By revisiting and curating these images, I've created a visual diary of one of the most difficult chapters of my life: documenting the reality of substance abuse and its consequences in unflinching detail.

Sharing these photographs serves multiple purposes.

First, it validates my own experience. Trauma can make you question your memories, minimize your suffering, or convince you that what happened wasn't real. Seeing the evidence—having it exist outside my own mind—confirms that I went through something significant and survived it.

Second, it illuminates the connection between trauma and mental health. Addiction doesn't happen in isolation. It's often a response to pain that feels otherwise unmanageable. By showing both the behavior and its roots, I hope to build understanding for those still struggling.

Finally, this work is an offering of hope.

The fact that I can look back at these images—that I'm still here to curate them, to speak about them, to transform them into art—is evidence that recovery is possible. The human spirit can survive devastating circumstances. There is always potential for healing and growth, even from the darkest places.
