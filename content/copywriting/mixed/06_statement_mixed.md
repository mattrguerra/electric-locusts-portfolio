## Statement

Some experiences resist language.

Bipolar mixed episodes exist in that space—where depression and mania collide simultaneously, creating a psychological state that feels impossible to describe to anyone who hasn't lived it. You're exhausted but unable to rest. Hopeless but agitated. Your mind races through darkness at impossible speed.

*Mixed* is the only work I could create during one of the darkest periods of my life.

This series doesn't attempt to explain mixed episodes—it attempts to *show* them. The visual chaos, the competing energies, the sense of being pulled apart from the inside. When I couldn't find words for what I was experiencing, I turned to images.

The work serves as both documentation and survival mechanism. Creating during crisis became a way to externalize internal chaos—to put something outside of myself that could hold what I couldn't contain alone.

I share this work because bipolar disorder remains deeply misunderstood. Mixed episodes in particular are rarely discussed, leaving those who experience them feeling isolated in their confusion. This series is for anyone who has felt that particular kind of alone.

You are not broken. You are not imagining it. And you are not the only one.
