# Artist Statement: Self Annihilation

*Mixed Media Series exploring identity, mental illness, and addiction*

## Statement

Identity has always been something I've struggled to define.

The search for where I fit in the world has caused me tremendous strife—an obsession that has shaped my entire life. I've lived with an unstable sense of self that has left me broken, confused, and uncertain of my place. How can you accomplish anything meaningful when you don't even know who you are?

This series began with self-portraits shot on medium format film. I would scratch and burn my own image from the negatives—physically removing myself from the frame. What started as destruction became something larger: a visual language for the hollow shell of a person trapped in the cycle of mental illness and substance abuse.

The work evolved into prints, an artist book functioning as a diary I allow others to read, and video pieces that hint at the devastating effects of addiction. Each medium offered a different way to approach the same impossible questions about self and survival.

*Self Annihilation* was the most difficult work I've ever created. It required me to excavate the darkest corners of my experience and present them without protection. But I believe in the power of this vulnerability.

If viewing this work inspires even one person to advocate for mental health care—or makes someone battling similar demons feel less alone—then every painful moment of its creation was worth it.
