## I Make the Inside Visible

Electric Locusts began as a survival instinct — a way to map the internal world when words alone weren’t enough.  
It documents becoming: the ruptures, the healing, the versions of self that loop, molt, collapse, reform.

I work in symbols because symbols let me say things too heavy to carry plainly.  
I work in structure because structure gives chaos somewhere to sit.  
I work in cycles because transformation isn’t linear.

The art isn’t decoration; it's documentation.  
Not of what happened, but of what it felt like.

## Artist Closing Statement
I’m still learning the language of myself.  
This work is how I speak.
