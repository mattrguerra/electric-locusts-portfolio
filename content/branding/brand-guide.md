# Electric Locusts — Brand Guide (Draft 2: Full Integration)

## Brand Essence
Electric Locusts is a personal mythology rendered through disciplined minimalism. It is both visual archive and psychological excavation — a structured space built to hold emotionally intense subject matter with clarity and care.

At its core, Electric Locusts expresses:
• quiet but charged  
• introspective but sharp  
• vulnerable but architecturally structured  

This duality defines the brand.
